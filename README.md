# QuantumSimulation

This package implements numerical simulations of the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger
equation using the split operator/split step and short iterative Lanczos
methods. It is designed for use in determining the time evolution of
wave packets.

This package is still in development and is liable to change significantly
without notice. Use at your own risk.
